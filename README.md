# Introduction

Electrical power systems are mainly composed of three parts as Generation, Transmission and distribution. To deliver the electrical power with the satisfactory voltage level, frequency and efficiency at the consumer end is the main purpose of power system.  For the appropriate designing, control as well as safe operation of power system some system studies such as load flow, short circuit, contingency etc. are performed by the electrical experts 

In this repo, I have covered loadflow analysis and short circuit analysis on different systems

## Load Flow Analysis

Loadflow analysis provide insights about how much power flown in the system at respective points

## Short Circuit Analysis

short circuit is the most severe one as it can cause the flow of huge amount of current in the system and this current have the ensuing affects such as the damage of equipment, breaking of fire due to extensive thermal heating and other harmful affects

The short circuit analysis is the most relevant study to overcome the disturbance that occur in the system. 

## ETAP Software

In the last years the electrical engineers have been dealing with power system studies by using modern software tools such as MATLAB, ETAP etc. In this study the load flow and short circuit studies are conducted by using the Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP 19.0.1) based 
on the American National Standard Institute (ANSI). Etap is the most comprehensive solution for performing the power system studies
